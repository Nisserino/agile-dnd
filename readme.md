 # __<h2> Gamedesign & Dungeon Run <h2>__
 
_Dungeon Run is a game where your goal is to loot as many treasures as possible. Inside the treasures you can find gold. The gold you loot is what defines your highscore. <br> Be careful, there are enemies waiting for you along the way. You can fight the enemies and kill them, and sometimes you can run away from them. <br> Once you have found all the treasures in a  room, you get moved to another room._
