__<h1>Overview</h1>__
_Dungeon Run is a game where your goal is to have fun, and loot as many treasures as possible. Inside the treasures you can find gold. The gold you loot is what defines your highscore. <br> Be careful, there are enemies waiting for you along the way.<br> You can fight the enemies and kill them, or sometimes run away from them. <br> Once you have found all the treasures in a  room, you get moved to another room._

When you spawn, the exit door is randomly placed somewhere not too close to you. Spawning enemies, treasures are also random._

#
_The objective of the game is to get as much gold as you can. To escape the dungeon
you need to find the room with an exit. When you find the exit room it will ask
if you want to leave or not.  
If you decide to leave, it will save all your gold
for that character. You can use that gold in the shop or keep it and try to get
as much as possible before dying.  
When your character dies or you give up(type give_up) it will save your name and
the amount of gold you have into the leaderboard. The leaderboard is ordered
by which character had the most gold when dying._
